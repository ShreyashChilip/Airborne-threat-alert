## üìå Project Overview

AeroSentinel is an **AI-driven airborne threat detection system** designed to revolutionize modern security and defense operations. By leveraging advanced object detection, tracking, and trajectory prediction, AeroSentinel automatically identifies and classifies airborne objects such as **birds**, **drones**, and **missiles** in surveillance footage. It differentiates between harmless objects (e.g., birds) and potential threats (e.g., drones or missiles), minimizing false alarms and enabling rapid, informed decision-making in critical scenarios.

Built with **YOLOv8** for object detection, **DeepSORT** for tracking, and **Kalman Filters** for trajectory prediction, AeroSentinel ensures high-speed inference and accuracy, even in challenging conditions like low-light or night-vision environments. The system features a user-friendly Flutter-based frontend for seamless interaction, a FastAPI backend for efficient video processing, and real-time threat analysis for enhanced situational awareness.

## üéØ Problem Statement

Traditional surveillance methods for airborne threat detection rely heavily on manual monitoring, which is inefficient and prone to human error. Distinguishing between non-threatening objects (e.g., birds) and real threats (e.g., drones, missiles) is a significant challenge, often leading to false alarms and delayed responses. AeroSentinel addresses these issues by:

1. **Automating Detection and Classification:** Using AI to detect and classify airborne objects in real-time surveillance footage.
2. **Reducing False Alarms:** Accurately distinguishing between birds and threats like drones or missiles.
3. **Ensuring High-Speed Inference:** Prioritizing rapid detection to support timely decision-making in operational environments.
4. **Enhancing Accuracy:** Fine-tuning models with transfer learning and data augmentation to handle diverse scenarios (e.g., varying backgrounds, lighting, and motion blur).

### System Architecture
1. **Frontend (Flutter App)**  
   - Users upload surveillance videos via the AeroSentinel app.
   - The app displays real-time analysis, including threat counts, risk assessments, and detection timelines.
   - Users can download annotated videos with marked threats.

2. **Backend (FastAPI)**  
   - Receives uploaded videos and processes them using the YOLOv8 model.
   - Logs detection results (e.g., object type, confidence, bounding boxes) and threat summaries.
   - Generates annotated videos and provides download links.

3. **AI Pipeline**  
   - **Object Detection:** YOLOv8 detects and classifies airborne objects in each frame.
   - **Object Tracking:** DeepSORT assigns unique IDs and tracks objects across frames.
   - **Trajectory Prediction:** Kalman Filters estimate future positions based on velocity and direction.
   - **Threat Assessment:** Objects are categorized into threat levels (Low, High, Critical) based on their class and behavior.

### Model Training
- **Dataset:** 30-minute video clips containing birds, drones, and missiles under diverse conditions (e.g., different lighting, backgrounds, and object speeds).
- **Training Approach:** Fine-tuned YOLOv8 using transfer learning on a pre-trained model.
- **Data Augmentation:** Applied techniques like brightness adjustment, motion blur, and background variation to improve model robustness.
- **Inference Optimization:** Achieved high-speed inference with a confidence threshold of 0.6 to balance accuracy and performance.
